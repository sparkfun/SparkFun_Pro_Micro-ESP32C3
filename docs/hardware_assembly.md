The SparkFun Pro Micro ESP32-C3 could be considered "plug and play", depending on the project. If you want to use any of the I/O pins, however, you'll need to solder something to the board. If you've never worked with castellated headers,we recommend checking out our [Castellated Mounting Holes Tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-castellated-mounting-holes) for more information.


??? note "New to soldering?"
	If you have never soldered before or need a quick refresher, check out our [How to Solder: Through-Hole Soldering](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) guide.
